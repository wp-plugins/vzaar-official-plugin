You can find this in your vzaar settings, under the tab marked 'Third Party & API'. This plugin requires an account with our Pro Toolkit. To upgrade, please contact sales@vzaar.com

= How do I embed video in a post? =

There's two ways of doing this:

1. In your post, click the 'add media' button, then select the 'vzaar media management' tab.  You can then add a video to the post, and choose the video's display options.
2. You can use the vzaar shortcode directly if you know the video ID: [vzaarmedia vid="918833" height="488" width="480" color="black"]
